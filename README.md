# YouTube Video Creator Robots

Five robots that work together to search texts, images, use Artificial Intelligence to create content, manage state, make a video and publish on YouTube! 🤖

Let's meet the robots:

## 📰 **Alex**, the text hunter

His job is to search articles, histories and news about some topic using Google's API.

## 📷 **Mia**, the image hunter

Mia search and downloads the best images related to the topic using Google's API.

## 📽️ **Tom**, the video maker

Tom grab what Alex and Mia retrieved and creates a video with it.

## 📢 **Fred**, the video uploader

To finish and share all the hard work to the human specie, Fred has one job: upload the video to YouTube!

## 👩‍🏭 **Lydia**, the orchestrator

To stop robots from messing up and taking over the world, we count on Lydia, the orchestrator.

She is the best at her job, instructing all robots working together without flaws like a maestro playing music.
