# YouTube Video Creator Robots

Four robots that work together to search texts, images, create video and publish on YouTube! 🤖

Let's meet the robots:

## 📰 **Alex**, the text hunter
His job is to search articles, histories and news about some topic using Google's API.

## 📷 **Mia**, the image hunter
Mia search and downloads the best images related to the topic using Google's API.

## 📽️ **Tom**, the video maker
Tom grab what Alex and Mia retrieved and creates a video with it.

## 📢 **Fred**, the video uploader
Last but not least, because without Fred's work, everything else would have been in vain: upload the video to YouTube!
