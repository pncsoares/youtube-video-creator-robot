# 📽️ **Tom**, the video maker

Tom starts to apply some stylings in the images collected by **Mia**, resizing them and even applying the TV effect* in some of them.

Tom knows how to work with Adobe After Effects but he is trying to find an open source alternative.

**TV Effect = Image duplicated in both sides, blured.*
