# ðŸ’¿ **Maria**, the state manager

In the future, Maria can use PostgreSQL, sequelize and migrations but for now, she will store all data locally in a file named `content.json`.

The data structure will be exactly the same used by Alex, our text robot.

You can see the data structure [here](./TextRobot.md/#data-structure).

## External packages

### `import fs from 'fs';`

fs enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.
